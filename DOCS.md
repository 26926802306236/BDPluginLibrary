# PluginLibrary

This is the documentation for Zere's Plugin Library. I recommend going through the namespaces located on the right hand side so you can get an idea of how the library is organized. From the namespaces you can get to the classes, members, and objects of each. All of those will have their own page with all the relevant functions and member functions documented with brief explanations for them.

## Coming Soon

Coming soon I plan to add tutorials/examples to the documentation.
